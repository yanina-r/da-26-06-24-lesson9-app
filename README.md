### Web Application for Stock Analysis
Built with Streamlit, this web application allows users to download stock data, view it as tables and graphs, and interact with various visualizations for analysis

## Application interface
The main page of the application with text boxes for entering stock symbols, sliders for selecting a date range, a button for uploading data and other controls.
